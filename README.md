# Math_Trainer
Basic math training program created by Aman Bhargava and the TCS Academic Support Department. This is meant to allow students to develop their skills from basic math to the Ontario grade 10 math level.


# 2017 October 18 Notes - Harding Meeting (DOJO Planning)

### Units in DOJO

* 'Survival Kit' - Integers
	* Addition/subtraction
	* Multiplication/division
	* Negative Numbers
	* BEDMAS
	* Translating algebraic expressions
		* Sum/product/quotient/difference vocabulary

* Fractions - Co-requisite for Algebra 2
	* What is a fraction (pie)
	* `Basic addition/subtraction (same denominator)`
	* `Basic multiplication (explain how word 'of' == times)`
	* Fractional equality (multiplying by 2/2 or 1/1 or 3/3)
	* `GCF`
	* `LCM`
	* `Common Denominator`
	* `Addition`
	* `Subtraction`
	* `Multiplication`
	* `Division`

* Algebra 1 - Co-requisite for Algebra 2
	* `Substituting in integer for x in an experession (all 4 operations)`
	* `Additional inverse`
		- a + (-a) = 0
	* `Multaplicative inverse`
		- What times _ is 1?
	* `Actual algebra solving (ls == rs)`

* Exponents
	* Basic intuition (Video)
	* `Explicit`
		- n^x
	* `FOIL/Why (x+2)^2 != x^2 + 2^2`
	* `Exponent Laws`
		- Multiplying
		- Dividing
		- Negative Exponent
		- Power of a Power
		- Power of Zero
	* `Fractional Exponents`

* Algebra 2 - DOJO 1.0
	* More complex algebra (linear equations)

* Algebra 3 - DOJO 1.0
	* Even more complex algebra (quadratics)

### Functionality (MVP, Survival Kit First)

* Create a framework for unit/part of tree to be selected
* Create methods for getting questions and answers
* Create a way for students to easily move from one question to the next
* Create a way to record student's activities

* Where possible, automate. 
* Add functionality to add questions required for a unit (i.e. instead of just doing 5, you need to do 10).
	- Implement a password?
* Implement a button to reset progress.
